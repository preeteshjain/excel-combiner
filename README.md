# Excel Combiner
This is a Python script that combines all the Excel files inside a folder to one single file.

## Note
* Python 3.7 is required to run this program along with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) libraries.
* This program only works with `.xlsx` files, however you can modify the script to work with `.xls` files as well.

## How to run
* Clone this repo
* Place Excel files in ***files*** folder
* Run the script with `python program.py`
* Wait for the magic! :rainbow:
